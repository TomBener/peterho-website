abstract: "Why would the removal of authoritarian institutions in some developing countries lead to sustained socio-economic crisis, while others experience explosive growth despite “persisting” informal, insecure and rent-seeking institutional arrangements? A key to solving this enigma lies in understanding China, a country where the paradoxes of development are highly visible. The book argues that understanding China’s economy necessitates an analytical refocusing from Form to Function, detached from normative assumptions about institutional appearance and developing instead a “Credibility Thesis”. In this reading, once institutions endogenously emerge and persist through actors’ conflicting interactions, they are credible. The book develops this idea theoretically, methodologically, and empirically by examining institutions around the sector that propelled, yet, simultaneously destabilizes development: real estate - land, housing and natural resources. It is shown how this sector can further both our understanding of institutions and issues of capital, labor, infrastructure and technology."

### **Reactions**

“The “Credibility Thesis” effectively articulated here is inspirational, innovative, and provocative with great potentials to advance theoretical inquiry into China's developmental model in a rapidly changing world.” **George C.S. Lin, The University of Hong Kong**

“This is an important book that challenges many commonly held assumptions about what works in development. It should be read not only by those interested in China’s economic trajectory but also by anyone interested in development theory and the reality of development.” **Tony Saich, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University**

“Mainstream economics is of little use in understanding China’s economic transitions since the late 1980s. Peter Ho is one of very few scholars capable of explaining the Chinese economy as it is rather than as western economists imagine—or wish—it to be. Attention must be paid to this message.” **Daniel W. Bromley, University of Wisconsin–Madison**
