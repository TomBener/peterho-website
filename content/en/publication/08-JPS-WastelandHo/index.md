abstract: "According to the statistics, China had a total of 108 million ha of undeveloped land or wasteland in 1995. Of this figure, 35.4 million ha is suitable for agriculture and 63.0 million ha is suited for forestry purposes [Zhang and Li, 1997: 1413]. Wasteland includes a wide variety of land resources scattered over the whole nation. It varies from forested hills and mountains in the subtropical region of Yunnan province to the dry steppe and pockets of desert in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. According to the definitions of the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, this undeveloped land can be divided into wasteland, waste mountains, sandy waste and waste gullies (huangdi, huangshan, huangtan and huanggou). The term 'wasteland', however, is misleading as a great portion of this land is in use by peasants for animal grazing, small-scale forestry and the exploitation of forest by-products, such as Matsutake mushrooms, medicinal herbs and animals. The direct use of wasteland generally yields low economic returns, while its ecology is often fragile. For this reason, the Chinese state has for long sought means to develop wasteland either for purposes of rural poverty alleviation, soil and water conservation, and even defence."
