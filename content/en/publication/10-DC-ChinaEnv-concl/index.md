abstract: "The contributions in this volume have sought to delve into the question of whether the greening of state and society is a reality or a myth, by highlighting the case of one of the world’s fastest developing and most populous countries: China. The rise of China has worried many observers as it has led to a heightened pressure on the resources of the nation and the world. This has become painfully clear as a result of a sharp rise in soil, water and air pollution within China, as well as rising Chinese demand for natural and mineral resources such as oil, gas, timber and steel. The critical question concerning China’s development is whether it can actually ‘meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’?"
