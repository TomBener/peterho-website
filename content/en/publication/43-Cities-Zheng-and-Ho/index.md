abstract: "Formal or de jure property rights are deemed conditional for development in a neo-liberal reading. Paradoxically, real estate underwent explosive development even though China’s rights for housing are informal, ambiguous, and insecure. This article intends to explain this contradiction by examining how Chinese urban residents perceive the credibility of housing rights from three perspectives, i.e., ownership, land lease, and the 70-year lease term. The study is based on a survey (n = 1207) demonstrating: i) half of the respondents are indifferent about formalization policies; ii) 92 percent have never experienced housing-related conflicts, however, of those reporting conflict, close to half indicated demolition as the source; iii) housing ownership is considered important for most while the land use (or lease) permit is considerably less relevant, and the lease term is considered insignificant. Three conclusions can be drawn. First, urban residents have no preference for a “full bundle” of formal rights. Second, although low conflict indicates credibility of the current rights structure, there are risks to social stability due to expropriation. Three, credibility hinges on combinations of (in)formality and (in)security rather than being a direct function of formalization. Findings emphasize a need to rethink the property rights theory in terms of credibility, conflict, and time."
