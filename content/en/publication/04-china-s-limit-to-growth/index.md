### **Reactions**

“This is a fascinating and indispensable book for anyone interested in the environmental impact of China's economic growth. China's environmental problems will impact everyone on the globe sooner rather than later. Like many Westerners, I had formed my own simplistic ideas about how China might address some of these issues. From this book I learned not only that most of my bright ideas had been tried -- and had flopped -- long ago, but also learned about exactly how they went awry.” **A.J. Sutter, University of Wisconsin – River Falls**
