abstract: "Developmental Dilemmas singles out land as an object of study and places it in the context of one of the world's largest and most populous countries undergoing institutional reform: the People's Republic of China. The book demonstrates that private property protected by law, the principle of 'getting-the-prices-right', and the emergence of effectively functioning markets are the outcome of a given society's historical development and institutional fabric. Peter Ho argues that the successful creation of new institutions hinges in part on choice and timing in relation to the particular constellation of societal, economic, political and cultural parameters. Disregarding these could result in rising inequality, bad land stewardship, and the eruption of land-related grievances."

### **Reactions**

“The “Credibility Thesis” effectively articulated here is inspirational, innovative, and provocative with great potentials to advance theoretical inquiry into China's developmental model in a rapidly changing world.” **George C.S. Lin, The University of Hong Kong**

“This is an important book that challenges many commonly held assumptions about what works in development. It should be read not only by those interested in China’s economic trajectory but also by anyone interested in development theory and the reality of development.” **Tony Saich, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University**

“Mainstream economics is of little use in understanding China’s economic transitions since the late 1980s. Peter Ho is one of very few scholars capable of explaining the Chinese economy as it is rather than as western economists imagine—or wish—it to be. Attention must be paid to this message.” **Daniel W. Bromley, University of Wisconsin–Madison**
