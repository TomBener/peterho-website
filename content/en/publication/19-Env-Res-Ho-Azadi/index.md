abstract: "Rangeland degradation, a worldwide problem, is serious in China, especially in the Northern provinces. To assess the pastoralists’ perceptions toward rangeland trend and degradation, a survey was conducted in Ningxia, North China. Data were collected from a total of 284 pastoralists in six Ningxia counties. Findings showed that the majority of respondents believe the rangelands in Ningxia have been degraded, although there are some disparities among the counties that illustrate differing severity of degradation. Findings also clarified that the pastoralists have more knowledge about the “technical” and “supportive” aspects of conditions, while remaining less aware of “economic” and “management” factors of this issue. Yet, a high disparity was revealed between pastoralists’ perceptions among the counties in this study. The correlation matrix showed that most of their perceptions do not act independently. Findings also showed that those pastoralists who believe that their rangeland trend is “improved” have broader management and social perceptions than those who believe their rangeland is “degraded”. Finally, correlation analysis showed that the management and social perceptions have a negative correlation with degradation severity. Based on the findings, recommendations for possible interventions through extension/educational programs to diminish rangeland degradation are made. The programs are suggested to be presented in three packages including “management”, “social”, and “economic” issues in rangeland degradation."
